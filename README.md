# USHousePriceIndexVis

This is a visualization based on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python that displays the historical data of US house price index with the functionality of predicting future house price index using machine learning algorithms.

---

**Current Status:**

* Allow users to view different years of US house price index from 1991 to 2022 using the Year slider
* By hovering over any states (highligthing that states with yellow selection), detailed information of the historical minimum and maximum will be displayed on the bottom right
* By clicking any states, the detailed information will be temporarily locked on the bottom right

**To Dos:**

* [ ] Dataset preprocessing and cleaning
* [ ] Implement additional filter options
* [ ] Implement zoom in and out function when clicking states
* [ ] Generate the historical graph and future prediction for 52 states
* [ ] Implement circles on the map that represents different counties
* [ ] Implement machine learning algorithm for different counties using pyscript and corresponding python library
